-TODO:
-Jwt support! //actual JWT SHOULD be finished, now a matter of adding auth to controller + front end (localstorage)
-Add UpdatePolicy Auth check (must be admin or person who created policy) (edit sql table, edit models.)
-Refactor code for normalized user 

-MAYBE:
-Add policy detail support on users too!! (normalized user -> changed interfaces, controllers, services, repos...)
	^note: i dont want users to become "tribalized", adding some sort of algorithm that only shows laws they agree with might cause that
	^maybe we can make it so that laws shown are only slightly aligned? an overlap to have an "i see where they are coming from" moment
	^will probably depend more on algorithms which is outside of current scope
-If you DO do this, make sure to refactor code so that "UserNormalized" actually gets used.

-JUST DONE:
-policies! they now properly update policy details and policy signers when updated and deleted


NOTE:
add env variable to make sure everything works!
